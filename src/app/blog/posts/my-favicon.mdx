if you see my favicon, you might be wondering what it is and why I chose it. well, let me explain.

## what is it?

it's crazy that I attached to an AI generated image, but I did. back in early 2022, when AI generated images were a popular arising trend, I was playing with some free websites that generated low-quality images.

at that time, I was playing on repeat "[Eyes Without A Face](https://open.spotify.com/track/0pUVeEgZuNyFzIMKp67RbS)" by [Billy Idol](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7lzordPuZEXxwt9aoVZYmG), and I thought it would be cool to have an image that visually represented the song.

<iframe
    style={{borderRadius: '12px'}}
    src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0pUVeEgZuNyFzIMKp67RbS?utm_source=generator"
    width="100%"
    height="152"
    allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
    loading="lazy"
    allowFullScreen
></iframe>

well, I know that the image doesn't represent the lyrics, but it does represent the vibe of the song. I also added my personal notes to the prompt (green eyes, stone face alike).

## conclusion

this blog post might be a little weird, but is more like a FAQ. it's cool that this has a story behind it
